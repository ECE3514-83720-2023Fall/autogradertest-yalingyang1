title: Exercise 26
---

In this exercise we will add a sorting algorithm. The sorting algorithm goes in YourSort as defined in the algorithms.hpp file. We can then benchmark the Selection, Bubble, and your algorithm. There is a Python program, "plotexample.py" that can plot the results--you will need to store the output of "benchmark_sort" in a file "temp.dat" for the Python program.

1. Create a working directory somewhere on your computer. Open your command line terminal and make a working directory. Then change to that directory.

2. Clone the assignment for today. Accept the GitHub classroom invitation. This will automatically add this repository accessible to you and the instructor/TAs with some starter files. You can then clone it to your computer using

	```
	git clone https://github.com/VT-ECE-3514/spring23-ex26-USER.git
	```
	
	where USER is your GitHub username. You may have to enter your GitHub 
	username and password.

3. Implement your sorting algorithm YourSort() in ``algorithms.hpp``. You can also look at the plotted data. Hopefully, your algorithm should be the best one!

4. Add the updates to your repository and commit the changes, e.g.

    ```
    git add -u
       git commit -m "implement mysort method"
    ```
    
5. Use git push to synchronize the repository with that on GitHub

    ```git push```
    
    You may have to enter your GitHub username and password again.

You have now completed the exercise.
